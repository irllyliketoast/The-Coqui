## Project Overview
This is a mini project created for the Management Information Systems (MIS) class. The website focuses on the Coqui, a native frog of Puerto Rico, and explores its cultural and ecological significance. 
This was meant to test my HTML and CSS skills early on in the class.
The project aims to showcase the unique features of the Coqui frog, including its role in Puerto Rican identity and the symbolism behind its displacement due to gentrification and environmental change.

## Features
- **Introduction to the Coqui Frog**: Learn about the Coqui, its characteristics, and its connection to Puerto Rican culture.
- **Facts about the Coqui**: Discover interesting facts about the Coqui frog, including its nocturnal habits and its iconic song.
- **Cultural Significance**: Understand how the Coqui frog has become a symbol of cultural loss and displacement in Puerto Rico.
- **Link to More Resources**: A link to the National Wildlife Federation for additional information.

## Technology Used
- **HTML**: The website structure is built with HTML, which defines the content and layout of the webpage.
- **CSS**: The styling of the webpage is handled using an external CSS file (`coquistyle.css`) to enhance the visual presentation of the site.

## Purpose
This website serves as a basic educational tool to share the story of the Coqui frog and its impact on Puerto Rican communities, linking ecological issues with cultural heritage.

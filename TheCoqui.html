            <li>The coqui frog is named after the sound it makes, "ko-kee."</li>
            <li>It is native to Puerto Rico but has spread to other regions.</li>
            <li>Coquis are nocturnal and are most active during the night.</li>
            <li>Their sound is a signature feature of Puerto Rican nights.</li>
            <li>Coquis come in various colors like brown and yellow, but the most common is green.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why does the Coqui matter?</h3>
        
            <p>The coquí, a small but significant frog endemic to Puerto Rico, holds deep cultural
            and ecological symbolism for the island and its people. Its distinct song is an 
            iconic sound, tied to Puerto Rican identity, echoing through the mountains and 
            forests that have traditionally been its natural habitat. However, the coquí's 
            connection to Puerto Rico’s sad history, especially regarding displacement, is
            profound.</p>
            
            <p>In the face of increasing gentrification and the broader economic crisis, 
            many Puerto Ricans are forced to leave their homes, with many migrating to the 
            mainland U.S. or seeking new opportunities in rapidly growing, urbanized areas on 
            the island. This pattern of displacement reflects a history of economic instability, 
            political mismanagement, and the ongoing effects of colonialism. Puerto Rico’s people,
            like the coquí, are often pushed out of their ancestral homes—whether due to 
            environmental degradation, the pressures of urbanization, or the effects of disasters 
            like Hurricane Maria.</p>
            
            <p>As gentrified cities in Puerto Rico grow, especially in places like San Juan and Saturce, 
            the natural habitats of the coquí are shrinking, and this has become a powerful metaphor 
            for the people who are also being forced out of their communities, their lands, and their 
            histories. The coquí leaving these once-rich, rural areas serves as a symbol of cultural 
            loss and the displacement of Puerto Ricans, both physically and emotionally. In the same 
            way that the coquí’s song is becoming quieter in urban areas, the voices of Puerto 
            Ricans—particularly those who lived in rural and less-developed areas—are being drowned out 
            by the interests of developers and external investors, who prioritize profit over community 
            wellbeing.</p>
            
            <p>The absence of the coquí in these urban spaces, or their migration to more remote 
            locations, mirrors the cultural erosion and identity shifts happening in Puerto Rican 
            communities. Just as the coquí’s song is a symbol of Puerto Rican pride and a reminder 
            of the island's natural beauty, its retreat signifies a loss—a tangible reflection of how 
            Puerto Ricans are being uprooted, displaced, and disconnected from the land that has 
            sustained them for generations.</p>
